# About

This project is an earnest attempt by a group of passionate software engineers to thrown some light on the recent onset of Covid-19 (Corono) virus which has turned out to be a serious pandemic to the entire world.

To contain this virus it is absolutely critical to understand the path of virus transmission so that safety and preventive measures can be taken against it. The project intends to capture the path of virus through an infected person or potential vectors (virus carriers). At this point the authorities are desperately trying to find, isolate and help the victims plus more importantly find potential "vectors". The sad or scariest thing is that the "vectors" are unware of their crossings with any victims and thus are unable to prevent further transmission to others knowlingly or unknowingly. 

This critical information that the project intends to unearth would be of grave help to everyone (including authorities) in terms of understanding the potential vectors, virus transmission path and associated geographic safe zones.

What this project is not?
