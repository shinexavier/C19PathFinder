# C19PathFinder

## About

This project is an earnest attempt by a group of passionate software engineers to leverage technology and throw some light on the recent onset of **Covid-19 (Corono)** virus which has turned out to be a serious pandemic.

To contain this virus it is absolutely critical to understand the path of it's transmission so that safety and preventive measures can be taken. The project intends to capture the path of virus through an infected person or potential *vectors (virus carriers)*. At this point the authorities are desperately trying to find, isolate and help the victims plus more importantly find potential *vectors*.

> The sad or scariest thing is that people are <ins>unaware</ins> of their pathway crossings with any victims (making them potential *vectors*) and thus are <ins>unable to prevent</ins> further transmission to others including their near and loved ones.

This critical information that the project intends to unearth would be of grave help to everyone (including Govt. and Health authorities) in terms of forming an understanding on the 
* Virus *transmission path*
* Potential *vectors*
* Geographically *affected zones*
* Geographically *safe zones*

## Approach

The project leverages the following software components to achieve its core objective:

* Smart Mobile Application

  * The mobile application should be downloaded and installed by everyone 
  attempts to **continuously** capture the travel path of an individual through the location services in his smart phone and scans for potential pathway crossings with a victim or potential *vector* around the same time.
