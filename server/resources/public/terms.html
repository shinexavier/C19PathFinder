        Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.

    </p>
    <b>WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</b>
    <p>In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to

        your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.
        We may process or share data based on the following legal basis:

        enforcement
        requirements).

        More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following

        other
        things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online
        activity.

        for
        their promotional purposes.
         Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of,
        any
        merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another
        company.
         Third-Party Advertisers. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Apps.
        These
        companies may use information about your visits to our Website(s) and other websites that are contained in web
        cookies
        and other tracking technologies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

        Cookie
        Policy.
    </p>

    <b>DO WE USE GOOGLE MAPS?</b>
    <p>In Short: Yes, we use Google Maps for the purpose of providing better service.
        This website, mobile application, or Facebook application uses Google Maps APIs. You may find the Google Maps

        of Service here. To better understand Google’s Privacy Policy, please refer to this link.
        By using our Maps API Implementation, you agree to be bound by Google’s Terms of Service. By using our
        implementation of
        the Google Maps APIs, you agree to allow us to gain access to information about you including personally
        identifiable
        information (such as usernames) and non-personally identifiable information (such as location). We will be
        collecting

        ■ __
        For a full list of what we use information for, please see the previous section titled "HOW DO WE USE YOUR
        INFORMATION?"
        and “WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?” You agree to allow us to obtain or cache your location. You
        may
        revoke your consent at anytime.
        The Maps APIs that we use store and access cookies and other information on your devices. If you are a user
        currently in
        the European Economic Area (EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), please take a look at our EU User

        Policy.
    </p>

    <b>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</b>
    <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
        notice
        unless otherwise required by law.
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        privacy
        notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
        requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 6
        months.
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
        backup
        archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
        until
        deletion is possible.
    </p>
    <b>HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</b>
    <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security
        measures.
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security
        of
        any
        personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself
        is
        100%
        secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information
        to
        and
        from our Apps is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.
    </p>
    <b>DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</b>
    <p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Apps, you
        represent
        that
        you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s
        use
        of
        the Apps. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
        deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
        aware
        of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at test@et.com.
    </p>
    <b>WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</b>
    <p>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
        If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
        information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can
        find
        their
        contact details here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
        Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can
        usually
        choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject
        cookies,
        this could affect certain features or services of our Apps. To opt-out of interest-based advertising by
        advertisers
        on
        our Apps visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
    </p>
    <b>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</b>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
        feature
        or
        setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
        activities
        monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
        finalized.
        As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates
        your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
        we
        will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
    </p>
    <b>DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</b>
    <p>In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your
        personal
        information.
        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are
        California
        residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of
        personal
        information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of
        all
        third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a
        California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the
        contact
        information provided below.
        If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Apps, you have
        the
        right
        to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Apps. To request removal of such data, please
        contact
        us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and
        a
        statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Apps, but
        please be
        aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
    </p>
    <b>DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</b>
    <p>In Short: Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
        We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
        “Revised”
        date
        and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this
        privacy
        notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a
        notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting
        your
        information.
